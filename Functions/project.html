    <h3>Reflection and Materials</h3>
    <p>
      I found Example one to be pretty simple, it was mostly covered in our
      lecture video for the week and our textbook had examples similar to it so
      I had little issues there. I wrote notes for myself on how I could
      accomplish the assignment and I think it helped a lot. The second and
      third examples however gave me more trouble. I planned for the second one
      to also be somewhat easy but what I thought would work didnt and I ended
      up having to write it a different way. The third example wasn't making
      sense to me. I kept attempting what was asked in the assignment but it
      just wasn't clicking. I would like to know where I failed and how I can
      improve it so that it works the way it is intended to.
